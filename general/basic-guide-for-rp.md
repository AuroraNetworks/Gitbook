\
**BAD =** I need to tab out for a second

### **Situational RP**

Sometimes, shit happens, And when that shit happens, your RP skills are tested. Things like accidents, crimes not caused by you, or disasters can really test you and your ability to improvise and Roleplay realistically.\
\
As a bystander, you should report what you see. Call 000 if you see a crime or accident and give as much information to the dispatcher as possible. Even if you didn't see the whole thing. If there's a crashed vehicle or someone lying on the ground unconscious, call 000. Stick around if you want and if safe and realistic. Things could get interesting.\
\
If you're involved in an accident or the victim of a crime, you need to respond as realistically and appropriately as possible. If you crash your car into a wall, you may be left unconscious or seriously injured. Wait for someone to call for help. If nobody helps then try to call for help with regards to your physical limitations. If someone is robbing your store, remain calm. Remember what they looked like, what they were wearing, where they went, and how they fled. If applicable, you can try to ward them away with a weapon, however, if they have any sort of firearm, it's very risky and not recommended. If there are other people working in your store, they can try to ward the robber away.\
\
If something happens that breaks the rules in that scenario, just continue with the scenario until its over then you can make a ticket in the discord.
