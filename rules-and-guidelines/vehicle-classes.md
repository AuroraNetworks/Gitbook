(9.1) Make sure to mask your location when streaming and going to a private or secret location. Meta guard when necessary.

(9.2) Meta-gaming occurs when a member of your chat provides you with knowledge that you may have overlooked or altogether new information, that you cannot utilize in-game.

(9.3) Your live stream is considered your ‚Äúpolice body cam‚Äù. The use of a police body cam as evidence is always possible. If a lawyer requests discovery in a case, it should be delivered as soon as possible, pending the case's acceptance. Because police body cams are expected to be turned in at the conclusion of each shift, they can be utilized by PD High Command to evaluate the repercussions of inappropriate police behavior.

(9.4) Do not stream other RP servers while you have a Streamer role in our discord.  It will be removed immediately without the possibility of obtaining it back.
