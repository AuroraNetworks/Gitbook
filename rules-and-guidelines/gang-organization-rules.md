# ðŸ”« Gang / Organization Rules

(5.1) Gangs, Organizations, and MCs can have a maximum of 15 members.

(5.2) If they are unwelcome, gang members must give non-gang members adequate notice to depart their turf before murdering them for trespassing at least once.

(5.3) A gang may ONLY tax ONE location. Crafting is excluded from this.

Example: If the weed has 4 steps or locations to it, you may only tax ONE of those locations. Picking, Processing, or Selling locations.

Crafting may NOT be taxed as it is one single spot.

(5.4) Only gangs that staff has approved to be "Official" gangs may tax areas. This prevents random people with groups of friends from coming in and trying to run everything.

(5.5) Only 1 of your characters may be associated with a criminal group/organization.  This protects the integrity of the roleplay and from metagaming and two characters assisting the same group for the same goal.

(5.6) Gang turf can be defended by the entire gang that is present on their turf. You may not join outside of your turf. Turf is defined by the following;\
\- Compounds

\- Buildings

\- The Cul De Sac of Grove Street (Example)&#x20;

\- Forum Drive
