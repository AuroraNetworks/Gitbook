# ‚ù§ New Life Rule (NLR)

(3.1) When you start a new life, your character will forget the events up to when you died. You do, however, remain the same person. (same job, gang, friends).

(3.2) When you are crippled and down long enough to bleed out and must press E to respawn at the hospital, a new life starts. Under no circumstance should you initiate your respawn unless either told to do so by EMS or you are incapacitated in the middle of nowhere and there are no EMS on duty.

(3.3) You may not return to the same spot where you died and continue roleplaying as if nothing had occurred if you had to respawn after being downed.
