# 🧠 General Roleplay Rules

(2.1) Vehicle Deathmatch (commonly referred to as VDM) is strictly forbidden. VDM includes, but is not limited to, purposefully running people over and injuring another player while driving, or speeding excessively with a vehicle in order to strike a motorbike and kill the rider/passenger.

You may NOT use your vehicle as a weapon to combat anyone else.

Example: A vehicle fleeing a scene and clipping someone by mistake is not considered VDM and is non-reportable.

(2.2) The act of killing/downing someone without first participating in quality roleplay is known as Random Deathmatch (also known as RDM). Directly initiating someone's life or having your own life initiated should always be part of the roleplay. You must also provide an incentive for individuals to participate and allow ample time for the RP to play out.

(2.3) Fear RP is not permitted. This means that you should always respect your life and behave accordingly in all situations. If a gun is leveled at you, for example, you must neither flee the situation without intending to RP nor should you draw a weapon and choose to fight. Humans are not quicker than bullets!

(2.4) Modifications that alter the game's functionality or how our systems/scripts function (also known as modding and scripting) are absolutely prohibited on our server and will result in a permanent ban. Visual mods to gain an advantage and menus are two examples of such alterations.\
\
Visual mods that do the following are not allowed to be used:\
\- Remove Night Time, turning it to Day.\
\- Remove Trees and bushes\
\- Remove Water \
\- Brighten up nighttime\
\- Alter Time Cycles in any way\
\- Increases FOV\
\- Stretches your screen to make bodies larger\
\- Stretched/Extended POV\
We understand that you may play on different servers that allow this, however, while you’re here, they need to be removed.&#x20;

(2.5) Abusing specific game elements (e.g., transporting people through walls/doors, over-using key bind emotes in the middle of a gunfight to avoid being shot, utilizing radio channels after your radio is confiscated, using your phone while handcuffed, forcing a third-party into a shared emote without their consent, etc.) as well as exploiting any in-game bugs are absolutely prohibited and will result in a ban.

To further explain the over-using of keybind emotes, what we mean by that is using them mid-gunfight to avoid getting shot doesn’t make sense.  Throwing your body to the ground over and over again isn’t physically possible, and definitely goes into the realm of FailRP.  You may keep the emotes keybinding if you’d like, but use them in a more realistic way as in when you’re hiding in a bush, crouching on a roof, or using a /e sit emote.  Something along those lines.  Do not abuse emotes to win in a gunfight.

(2.6) Any threats made to the community or a person will be taken very seriously. A permanent ban will be issued without the chance to appeal

​(2.7) Combat logging is not allowed. We are aware of typical crashes, connection troubles, and other issues; however, this is often reflected in the logs, and staff will make an educated assessment on whether you attempted to remedy the issue by logging back on, for example.

(2.8) Trolling is the purposeful act of engaging in particular behaviors in order to elicit a response. We have a pretty clear list of what constitutes trolling, but we highly encourage you to use your common sense.

(2.9) Power gaming is strictly prohibited. This occurs when you prioritize progress toward a certain goal over other factors such as narrative (role-playing) and atmosphere. ​ Power gaming incidents, such as the ones listed below, will be evaluated at the discretion of the staff team and dealt with appropriately.

Examples of power gaming include but are not limited to:

\- Using Emotes in jail to avoid the AFK timer.\
\- Using friends within your gang/org as a hostage.\
\- Using mechanic tools/abilities to remove upgrades from local vehicles or other players’ cars that are not paying for upgrades\
\- Camping the hospital OR starting apartments in order to continuously rob victims or ensure they are unable to be revived.\
\- Hiding in an apartment or any other instanced location in order to avoid conflict\
\- Specifically robbing banks/stores with the intent of leaving before roleplaying with cops.\
\- Forcing conflict with people who are just loading in the server\
\- Robbing stores/banks, doing heists/car boosting less than 60 minutes before the server restarts or 30 minutes after restarts \
\- Going to a garage and pulling out a new car mid-chase\
\- Changing walk styles to gain an advantage over running from other people/cops.\
\- Flying a helicopter into prison to break people out of jail. (Please do prison breaks using the mechanics for it we have in place)\
\- Not waiting at least 10 minutes following a heist, bank robbery, store robbery or prison break for police to arrive.  \
\- Hitting more than one bank truck at a time

(2.10) The act of failing to roleplay in a reasonable manner is known as fail RP, and it is a punishable offense.\
Examples of Fail RP consist of:\
\- Extremely excessive or exploitative driving, such as taking large jumps or abusing off-roading.\
\- At the jail, passing stuff via the fence/gate.\
\- During an ongoing RP crisis, not acting out injuries\
\- When someone points a gun in your face, you may not pull a gun or flee\
\- Returning to the same scenario immediately following injuries severe enough to down your character\
\- Carrying someone while driving a vehicle, including motorcycles\
\- Escorting a hostage while simultaneously robbing a store/bank, or any other activity where it wouldn’t make sense to be able to fully restrain an adult while also performing needed tasks.\
\- Utilizing vehicles obtained from military properties (Fort Zancudo / Aircraft Carrier)\
\
(2.11) Discord and other OOC channels should not be used to replace in-game radios or to settle roleplay problems. This implies you shouldn't use Discord or any other OOC channel to make tactical decisions in roleplaying circumstances like gunfights, raids, or robberies/heists. This is known as metagaming, and it is not permitted.

(2.12) When all of your communication devices are taken away from you, you must communicate solely through direct voice chat. There are no distress calls or pings allowed.

(2.13) If you visit or transport a fallen player to Pillbox Hospital for treatment, make sure to give any EMS on duty the opportunity to handle the situation. Unless EMS specifically instructs you to do so, do not rush past them into the hospital to check-in. If you get to the hospital and no one is present, you may either wait for EMS to arrive, call EMS on your phone, etc. Failure to do so will result in a warning, and subsequent violations will result in the same punishment as any other regulation.

(2.14) Behaving "salty," breaking character, or acting immature at any time in the game, especially while downed, will be deemed Fail RP and will result in an automatic ban, no questions asked. Situations in-game are required to be completed, regardless of how you feel about them. Nothing in the game should be taken too seriously. Whatever happened, it happened to your character, not to YOU.

(2.15) Metagaming is defined as the use of intelligence that was not earned via roleplay to affect in-game activities.

Examples of this include but are not limited to:

\-Using a person's allocated ID to identify them.

\-During an ongoing RP issue, using Discord or any other OOC means of contact to seek aid or provide any information.

\-Information that is gathered from any OOC source. (For example, Discord, Twitch, and Youtube).

\- You are not allowed to be in a stream and in the city at the same time, if you are caught doing this, you will be warned, kicked, then banned. This is to avoid any accidental meta.

\- Forcing someone to give up locations (not including the location of a specific player)

​(2.16) Do not body camp/dump. Body camping is the act of waiting around the area of a dead body to ensure no EMS can get to them.​ Body dumping is the act of carrying/dragging a dead body to an area where it would be impossible for EMS to get to them.​ Moving a dead body to a nearby dumpster, garage, river, or bush is not considered body camping/dumping.​ After downing another player, you may move them ONCE, while still following the above rules.

(2.17) Do not attempt to stop EMS from roleplaying

\- Do not interfere with EMS when they are responding to calls

\- Respect the fact that we have EMS for a reason, they roleplay a character in the medical field and if we stop them from doing their job then they will have no reason to roleplay here

\- Do not force EMS to revive you or your friends on the scene.  This is denying them the opportunity for further medical RP, and also does not make sense that you or your friend are perfectly fine with just a med pack after being shot down.

\- If you down another player you are not allowed to try and coerce the EMS not to go to that call

(2.18) Jumps/Dropdowns are completely prohibited.&#x20;

This includes the following

* Ramps
* Drop Downs (Such as the power street drop down to the legion square, driving off the end of the pier, etc.)
* Or any type of action in a vehicle that will send your vehicle flying through the air.&#x20;
* However, we do understand accidents happen, so if you spin out and flip over a bridge or you spin out and go over a drop-down, we’ll understand. However, you should roleplay as if your vehicle is disabled.&#x20;

(2.19) No Emotional Damaging RP. This includes rape, suicide or pregnancy RP, or anything that is considered overwhelmingly depressing. &#x20;

(2.20) Cannot hold a Business License or owner role and be a felon.  Cannot hold more than one business license between all characters.

(2.21) Roleplay as an animal:

* Must be staff-approved / or K9 Division Lead approved
* Must fully roleplay as an animal, no talking, no making animal sounds yourself, or doing /me’s that would represent any human emotions or replies
* If you want to utilize a soundboard with appropriate animal sounds that is okay
* For Police K9 you must follow all SOPs and Training provided by PD
* Unless you are RP’ing as an animal DO NOT use the Animal Emotes
* You are allowed to use any animal ped BESIDES the Pd-k9s, Elephant, Monkeys, Birds, or Sea Creatures.

(2.22) Using motorcycles/dirt bikes as the primary getaway vehicle from a robbery/heist is considered power gaming.  You can use motorcycles as a secondary getaway vehicle though.  For example, you leave the bank/store/heist location in a car then drive to where you have a bike staged and waiting, and then switch vehicles. &#x20;

(2.23) Green events: Green Events are server-wide events where initiating violence is prohibited.  If you have questions about what is considered a Green Event and what is not, please make a staff ticket.  If someone would like their event to be considered a Green Event you’d need to make a ticket and staff can vote on it.  If the event is approved as a Green Event it will be announced in the discord.

Green Events include, but are not limited to:\
\- Staff-ran events, such as races, auctions, etc. (will be stated in #event-announcements if it’s Green or not)\
\- Weddings

(2.23.1) Green Events: Auctions\
When it comes to auctions, you must make sure that every one that is bidding is present in the city.

* Before the auction, you must show proof of income
* If you can’t make it to the auction, you must make a ticket and show your character's income.&#x20;
* If you are using someone else's money, you must collect it BEFORE the auction starts.&#x20;
* You may NOT use someone else's money that\
  1\) Does not play here any longer, their money is already in the void\
  2\) Is not present to give you the money at the auction.
* You may not bid auctions with money you DO NOT have.

(2.24) Loitering around the hospital, Eclipse Medical Tower, is prohibited.  It does become a nuisance for EMS and PD when there are loads of people outside the building just hanging around.  The large crowds can become overwhelming for the people who have legitimate roleplay in that area.

(2.25) Characters are limited to 3 jobs in the city.  This is to help “spread the wealth” to newer members of the community who are trying to become more invested in the city. &#x20;

(2.26) Special Vehicle Purchases:

* Monthly Patreon Vehicles: Cannot be sold for in-game money, but may be gifted.  Only 1 purchase per person, per month
* Gang / Business Cars purchased through the Tebex Store: ONLY official members of the gang/group/business may purchase one of these specific vehicles.  If you leave the group that the vehicle is “owned” by you must transfer the vehicle to another member of the group, preferably the head of the group.&#x20;
