# ðŸš‘ EMS Rules

EMS is a position that isn't primarily concerned with warfare. Your duty is to assist those who have been harmed, no matter who they are. EMS, like the police, is a vital aspect of the city, and participating in it may put you in some amazing roleplay scenarios.

(8.1) When you go off-duty as a medic, you must dispose of all hospital-provided equipment and vehicles.

(8.2) EMS is in charge of determining if a player requires emergency surgery. The status of an incapacitated player should be checked by EMS at all times.

(8.3) Selling/gifting EMS equipment to civilians is strictly prohibited.

(8.4) Medical equipment cannot be taken from EMS. Bandages are included in this. As a citizen, you are not supposed to be able to heal severe/fatal wounds since that violates the objective of the EMS profession and system. Bandages purchased in a convenience shop or elsewhere are suitable for usage.

(8.5) If there are less than three EMS and four police officers on duty, EMS cannot be held hostage or abducted, although this does not apply to members of the Medical Board (Chairmen, Co-Chairman, Treasurer and Secretary).  This is to avoid misuse and the need for PD/EMS to rescue one another 24/7, while yet allowing for the RP of kidnapping/hostage situations when necessary.

(8.6) EMS personnel are held accountable for their acts and are not exempt from civic ordinances. If they are discovered breaching the law (e.g., shooting someone in self-defense, trafficking narcotics, etc.), police officers and the Department of Justice can and will pursue them to the full extent of the law.
