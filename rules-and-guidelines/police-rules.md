# üëÆ Police Rules

Acceptance as a police officer on the server is considered a privilege. Breaking rules, especially these, may come with a removal from your position immediately.

(7.1) Police equipment (weapons, goods, etc.) cannot be traded with players outside the force. All armory products, such as ammunition or teasers from the police armory, are subject to this rule.

(7.2) It is not allowed to utilize your legal role on the police force to aid friends.

(7.3) If you are no longer on the police force you must dispose of any equipment or vehicles you received from the department. You may not come into PD and take equipment if you have been dismissed from PD but still have PD duties. This is seen as exploitation and is prohibited.

(7.4) While off-duty, you may not obtain equipment from the police department.

(7.5) If a police officer goes off duty they must store their police-issued equipment away in their squad car. They may carry an M9 pistol, but things such as PD Glocks, tasers, armor, iFak, baton, handcuffs, etc, must be stored in their car at MEL900.  Police officers are not protected by the ‚Äúno-rob‚Äù rule when they are off duty, therefore we cannot risk having PD equipment stolen and in the hands of non-PD members of the community.

(7.6) Body cams automatically get uploaded to the ‚Äúcloud‚Äù.  Criminals cannot ‚Äú/me takes body cam‚Äù.  If someone tries to do this it does not delete your body cam footage.
