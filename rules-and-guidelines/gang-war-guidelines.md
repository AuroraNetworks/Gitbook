# üß® Gang War Guidelines

(6.1) Gang wars are strictly Gang v. Gang.  No outside help from any source for the time being. No adding members to your gang once the war has started.  Every member who is officially in the gang (holds the role in the city), must participate in the war and follow all rules.

(6.2) Terms MUST be made, as there needs to be an end to every war.  Meet up in the city, make terms, and then confirm it with staff.  Please be VERY detailed in your terms so there is no confusion.  You must come to an agreement, otherwise there is no war.  A gang is not allowed to back out of war is the reason and terms are deemed reasonable by staff.  If a gang doesn‚Äôt want to fight they can automatically forfeit and carry out whatever promise/payment was deemed reasonable for the losing side.

(6.3) The dev team will provide each side with 50 items to finish the war.  Both sides will get something to indicate their ‚Äúlives‚Äù, i.e., bandanas, chains, cuts, and tags.  Once one side runs out of their ‚Äúlives‚Äù they lose the war.  They will be robbable items in your inventory.  One opposing side can also give up, pay off the other gang, etc.

* Once a War Item is removed from your person you cannot retrieve it back...just used as counters so staff doesn't have to comb through logs to track deaths
* You may retrieve a War Item from an opposing member of the war by downing them and robbing them, or just simply robbing them
* The max number of 50 flags may be negotiated differently if both sides mutually agree while setting terms

(6.4) Once war is over you may continue to be hostile to each other, but do not start another war without reason.

(6.5) Both sides must keep a ‚Äúlife/item‚Äù on them at all times during the war.  If not, and it‚Äôs proved intentional or it‚Äôs a recurring problem then you may automatically forfeit the war.

(6.6) Once terms are set you may not add more members to your gang.  They must be active members of the gang that isn‚Äôt just flying in for a gang war.

(6.7) The only help or involvement you can have from people outside of your group during times of war is if you are buying items from another group that they craft.  (For example: MOB crafts Sniper Rifles, and you purchase them from MOB.  You cannot purchase guns from MOB that they do not craft)

* Getting guns, ammo, armor, or any other resupply from people who do not craft those items is not allowed.

(6.8) Max length of time a war can last is 3 weeks from the time the terms are agreed upon.

* Whichever side holds more items from the other side will be the winner of the war.&#x20;
* The length can be renegotiated if both sides mutually agree while setting terms

(6.9) All members of the war must wear their gang clothing.  It can be just a mask, or a pocket flag, etc, but must be something noticeable.  If you are the only member of your gang in the city at the time you may black out.
