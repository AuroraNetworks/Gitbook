# ðŸ‘ª Community Guidelines

Our community consists of adults over the age of 18, however, we appreciate and acknowledge the younger players on this server and will not allow any kind of prejudice or bullying. For the offenses listed below, people are seldom unbanned.

Staff will issue permanent bans with a chance of appeal for every offense, with the exception of a few more egregious acts such as cheating, which wonâ€™t be allowed to be appealed. We issue the initial perma ban to ensure that people come in and talk to us prior to returning to the server.  This gives us a better feel for who the person is, and vice versa.  Sometimes itâ€™s just a misunderstanding and we ask you to have patience and understanding. &#x20;

(1.0) Breaking roleplay and using in-game voice chat to go OOC is strictly prohibited.

(1.1) Bullying, Harassment, Toxicity, or Targeting is punished with a permanent ban without appeal.â€‹

(1.1.1) If the staff has given you orders to avoid a certain individual for a period of time in order to reduce reports and conflict, you must obey those directions or face a permanent ban without the ability to appeal. Failure to do so will result in a violation of rule 1.1, which is Targeting and Harassment.

(1.2) Discrimination, racism, sexual harassment, and sexism will all be penalized with a lifetime ban. Racist slurs/slang are never acceptable, no matter what context they are spoken in. Roleplaying rape or using vulgar language or behavior is not permitted.

(1.3) Any threats made to the community or a person will be taken very seriously. A permanent ban will be issued without the chance to appeal.

(1.4) The majority of our community is made up of either NA or EU players where English is the primary language. That being said, you must speak English on our server, unless it is for short-term RP interaction.

(1.5) Due to this being an 18+ community you must be 18+ to own a business, head a department, or lead an Official gang/organization.

(1.6) Please make a realistic character name.  Using the same names as public figures, past or present, isnâ€™t allowed.  Be creative, be unique.  Any names that could be offensive are not allowed.
