# üé≠ Criminal Rules

(4.1) It is strictly prohibited to target EMS or police officers without reason. Hunting down and killing/robbing police officers without first engaging in roleplay will be labeled as RDM or Fail RP, accordingly. Stealing emergency vehicles (such as police cars and ambulances) is only allowed if you have a prior connection with an EMS or police officer and a very good roleplay reason to do so.

(4.2) You are not allowed to loot cops for their equipment after they have been downed, loot their trunk or hold up a cop for their weapons.

You are allowed to retrieve items that were previously confiscated from you if you are still currently in the same rp scenario when it was originally confiscated.  You cannot demand it after the fact and ask the officer to go retrieve your item from PD evidence. &#x20;

(4.3) Police officers cannot be held hostage unless there is a reasonable amount of police officers on duty to handle the situation.  Please use common sense here.  The abduction of an officer necessitates the use of high-quality, genuine RP. Keep it to a reasonable level. The abduction of an officer will also include extra police response.

(4.4) Roleplay initiation does not begin simply because the cops turn on their lights and sirens to pull you over. This implies you can't start firing at cops merely because they're trying to pull you over. RDM will be applied if you shoot first without a valid RP or initiation.

‚Äã(4.5) You can not try to extort additional money or stuff from someone while robbing them; you can only take what they have in their inventory. This means you can't take someone to a bank and demand they take money out of it or compel them to sell their car to you, and you can't remove anything from their residence.&#x20;

(4.6) Unless there was RP prior to initiation, robbing/killing other players in a safe zone is absolutely prohibited. In other words, someone can only be assaulted in a safe zone if anything happened within the last couple minutes before the victim entered the zone.  The assault period is not allowed inside of a green zone unless there is prior rp (chasing someone from outside to in).

Green zones consist of:

\--Life Invader

\--Inside Eclipse

\--Starting Apartments

\--Clothing Stores

\--Barber Shops

(4.7) There can be a maximum of 6 persons participating on the criminal side and 6 police officers/other crims. This isn't to say you can't collect narcotics or hang out in groups of more than five, but if you're in a scenario involving a gunfight, criminal activity, a vehicle pursuit, etc., any players on your side who number more than six must leave.

If a panic button is pressed by the police, all AVAILABLE UNITS will drop what they‚Äôre doing and respond.

(4.7.1) The 6 v 6 is extended to 8 criminals, this would include the inmates being broken out of prison vs 8 police officers in the case of a prison break. In the case of a police raid, the 6 criminals vs 6 cops maximum is increased to 8 criminals versus an 8-man SWAT team. When the police attack a known gang hideaway, they may anticipate the gang to reply in kind to the entire SWAT team.

(4.8) You are considered a member of the 6v6 if you are serving as a lookout, conveying information/tactics over the radio, or engaging in any manner in a crisis. Just because someone goes down or departs the radio after participating does not mean they are no longer counted in the 6v6 total.

(4.8.1) The 6v6 is extended to anyone inside the business vs the 6 attacking. You are attacking a business full of its people, and they have a right to defend themselves.&#x20;

(4.9) Other criminals need to avoid becoming involved in rp scenarios between two gangs or between one group and the police. Inserting yourself into rp scenarios at random only serves to spoil the RP for both sides.

‚Äã(4.9.1) Rule 4.8 does not include standard police reactions to shootouts and other incidents, as it is their responsibility to respond to criminal activity. However, if police are called to a shooting between two parties, the situation is likely to turn chaotic, and it is advised that all three factions try to share the situation as evenly as possible. In this case, anyone who was not originally involved in the incident (i.e., not one of the three factions) should not get involved.

(4.10) Do not get plastic surgery with the intent to drastically change your appearance if you are wanted by PD. Examples of what is NOT allowed: Changing your face, age, etc. Examples of what IS allowed: Changing outfits, dyeing hair, putting on a mask, shaving off your beard, etc.

(4.11) It is not allowed to rob consumers or workers at any civilian job location since you are robbing them where they receive their paycheck. This is referred to as power gaming.

(4.12) Criminals are not permitted to dress up as cops. Special engagement rules apply to both police and criminals, therefore clothing and acting like a cop will be deemed power gaming and exploiting the engagement rules between the two groups.

(4.12) Body cams automatically get uploaded to the ‚Äúcloud‚Äù.  Criminals cannot ‚Äú/me takes body cam‚Äù to try and delete PD body cam.

(4.13) Cannot force another player to give you items from their business or personal stashes (not including trunks).  The only exceptions are PD raids and if you're attempting to retrieve an item(s) that were recently robbed from you.
